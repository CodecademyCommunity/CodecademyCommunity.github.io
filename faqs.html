                    <b>A:</b> Most issues connecting to codecademy are caused by a local issue, if you are struggling to
                    connect, try to ensure you have a strong internet connection and disable any VPNs, adblockers etc.
                    If that does not work, attempt the steps in the below article:

                    <b>A:</b> Estimates for the lengths of all Codecademy courses should be displayed in the catalogue page
                    for the relevant course however it is important to remember that these are just estimates, and the actual
                    time it may take to complete the course will not be the same for everyone.
